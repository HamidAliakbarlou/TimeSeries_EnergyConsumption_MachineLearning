# Predicting Energy Consumption Using Machin Learning models

In this project, we examined the efficiency of different machine learning models on a big time-series data set!
our target feature is forcasting the building's thermal load.

ML models are applied to examine the impact of temporal (i.e., one-min, 15- min, and hourly intervals) and spatial (zone and floor level) granularity on the load predictions of an office building. As a part of this project, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) models are applied to a sensor-based gathered dataset for an office building in Bangkok, Thailand. 

The results show that the predictions obtained from the ANN model is much closer to the actual values than the MRL model predictions. Moreover, both models forecast the building load much better using the floor level and hourly time intervals data. Our findings have a practical significance for deploying and installing advanced smart metering devices by finding the scales for which data can be extracted and transformed into meaningful information.


This was our final project for a course named “Big Data Analytics for Smart City Infrastructure”, Winter 2022.
